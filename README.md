# ABCDEF
You are given a set S of integers between -30000 and 30000 (inclusive). Find the total number of sextuples (a,b,c,d,e,f):a,b,c,d,f@S,d!=0 that satisfy: (((a*b)+c)/d)-e=f

Input The first line contains integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the size of a set S. Elements of S are given in the next N lines, one integer per line. Given numbers will be distinct.

Output Output the total number of plausible sextuples.
